This plugin makes it easy to add the appropriate meta robots tags to your pages, as well as do some other SEO related actions.

== Description ==

Thereâ€™s no easy way to add meta robots tags to WordPress pages, unless of course, when you install this plugin.

This plugin makes it possible (and very easy) to:

* Prevent indexing of your search result pages, while still allowing the search engines to follow the links on them, by adding noindex,follow robots meta tags.
* Prevent indexing of your login, register and admin pages by adding noindex robots meta tags.
* Add noodp an noydir meta robots tags, allowing you to opt out of DMOZ and Yahoo! Directory descriptions.
* Prevent Yahoo! and Google from indexing your feeds by adding a meta tag to their head-section.
* Disable author and date-based archives.

And as soon as WordPress 2.3 is released, this plugin will make it possible to:
* Prevent indexing of just your comment feeds.
* Enforce a trailing slash on archives.
