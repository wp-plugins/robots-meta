This plugin makes it easy to add the appropriate meta robots tags to your pages, disable unused archives, nofollow unnecessary links as well as do some other SEO related actions.

== Description ==

There's no easy way to add meta robots tags to WordPress pages, unless of course, when you install this plugin.

This plugin makes it possible (and very easy) to:

* Prevent indexing of your search result pages, while still allowing the search engines to follow the links on them, by adding noindex,follow robots meta tags.
* Disallow indexing of subpages to your homepage, category pages, author pages and tag pages, to prevent duplicate content.
* Prevent indexing of your login, register and admin pages by adding noindex robots meta tags.
* Add noodp an noydir meta robots tags, allowing you to opt out of DMOZ and Yahoo! Directory descriptions.
* Prevent Yahoo! and Google from indexing your feeds by adding a meta tag to their head-section.
* Prevent indexing of just your comment feeds.
* Disable author and date-based archives.
* Nofollow category listings on single pages and posts to prevent PageRank leakage.
* Nofollow your login, register and admin links, because they really don't need PageRank.
* Enforce a trailing slash on archives.
* Edit your .htaccess and your robots.txt from within WordPress.
* Assign robots meta tags to individual posts & pages.
* Verify your site with Google Webmaster Tools and Yahoo! Site Explorer.
* Add noarchive tags to your blog (Thanks to [Henryk Gerlach](http://blog.littleimpact.de/index.php/2008/07/03/noarchive-tag-for-robots-meta/)).
